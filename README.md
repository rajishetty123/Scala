Patternmatching :
1. There are two fruits basketsâ€”A and B. Basket A contains an even number of
apples and an odd number of oranges; basket B contains an odd number of apples
and an even number of oranges. For a given number of apples and oranges, write
a program to detect which basket the combinations were picked from. Here are
the rules:
a. If an odd number of apples and an even number of oranges are required, these
should be picked from basket B.
b. If an even number of apples and an odd number of oranges are required, these
should be picked from basket A.
c. If an even number of apples and an even number of oranges are required, these
should be picked from somewhere else.
